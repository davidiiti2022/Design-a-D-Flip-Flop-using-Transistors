# Design-a-D-Flip-Flop-using-Transistors
Developed and implemented a D flip-flop circuit using discrete BJT transistors to achieve edge-triggered data storage. The design includes transistor-level logic gates and feedback paths to reliably capture and hold input data on the clock edge, demonstrating fundamental sequential circuit operation at the transistor level.
